            The Girls in Stem Are Secondary School Girls, that had little or no knowledge in tech, but with the help of a Great Woman, the Wife of the Governor (Eyoanwan Otu) in collaboration with Guru Innovation Hub, 502 girls in Ugep received the light of tech, and they were enlightened. The passion to learn more has been set ablaze in our hearts, as we seek the environment to implement it.

                    STRENGTH FOR GOOD LISTENER   
                </p>
                <p class="full-description">
                    Once upon a time, there was a training program which was held in ITM. This programme lasted for about a week and some few days. A named strength of about ten years old was also present in that tranining program. Although she was present,
                    but not for all the program dates. She had some days from her program calendar . Each day she made a present attempt, she will rather stay dull in the labortory but her photographic memory was never done. Each time a question was asked, she would lift up her small hand, but it was not noticed. On this fateful day, she was present her eyes opened, ears listening, brain attemptive but it seemed she was absent becaus of her physical appearance. A test was given in the form of an assignment. She went home, worked on the tset assignment and used it as her work book or reference point. the program taining was about to be through but lectures were to end on a particular day which was saturday afternoon. At noon we were asked to create new games. She still behave as if her mind was absent but eyee present. This attitude was noticed and our facilitator master Prince Obeten asked her to stand up that she has been dull for a long period of lectures no paticipation from her. So she timidly tried but her inner mind was active when she was through she excelled grantly more than even those who seemed they payed attentive ears to the facilitator. She successfully passed that test and became the best student and  game builder.
                    STEM is nw a proud organization and happy to teach or educate students on gaming and any field of studies which you will wish to be involved in. She has made the STEM organization proud and also the ITM body happy for rendering a space to the Guru Innovation Hub. She likely happy with herself and also the parents are happy their child out for computer gaming traning.
